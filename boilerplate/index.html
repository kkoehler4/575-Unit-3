                        But not all kids are equally prepared to enter the education system.

        <div class="description">    
            The R4K!S is not a direct assessment of students, but the observations from teachers over the first few weeks 
            of school. The teacher assesses each student based on six dimensions of readiness:
            social and emotional development, communication, physical health, 
            cognitive development, knowledge, and approaches to learning.

        </div>  
        <div class="description">   
        <br>
            Teachers assess the students based on these dimensions using a four-level scale to calculate overall readiness. Students whose “Total Scores” fall into categories
            three and four (“Ready and Practicing” and “Ready and Performing Independently”) are identified as ready. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Vermont’s concept of school readiness is interactional: students need to
        be ready for schools, and schools need to be ready to accommodate the diverse needs of every child.

    <div class="description">    
        Overall, 86.24% of Vermont students were deemed ready for Kindergarten in 2021. 
        8% more girls were ready for Kindergarten than boys, 12% more kids not elegible for
        free and reduced lunch were ready than kids elegible for free and reduced lunch, and 6% 
        more kids who attended publicly funded pre-k were ready than kids who did not attend
        private pre-k.

        This visualization can provide important insight for supervisory unions into the varying

      <center><h2>What is the future of public education in Vermont?</h2></center>
    <div class="description">    
            Vermont is facing an education crisis. The state's student population has dropped by 21,000
            since 1997 and continues to decline. At the same time, per-student spending has increased and the 
            staff to student ratio has stayed the same, causing an increase in property taxes. Small, rural
            schools, some with less than 50 kids across 6 grades, are forced to close and consolidate. With 
            this school consolidation comes the loss of close communities, but also more opportunities for kids
            to make friends and connections, a conflict that has divided parents and community members in Vermont
            in recent years. 
        <br>
        <br>
            How Vermont schools meet the needs of kids entering Kindergarten may change as the structure
            of public education in Vermont also changes, with varying consequences for different demographics.
