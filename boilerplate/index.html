        <div class="description">    
            The R4K!S is not a direct assessment of students, but the observations from teachers over the first few weeks 
            of school. The teacher assesses each student based on five dimensions of readiness:
            Social and emotional development, communication, physical health, 
            cognitive development, knowledge, and approaches to learning (e.g., enthusiasm for learning, persistence,
            curiosity). 

            
           Vermont’s concept also reflects the belief that “school readiness” is interactional: students need to
            be ready for schools, and schools need to be ready to accommodate the diverse needs of each and every child. 
          
        <br>
        <br>
            Teachers assess the students based on these dimensions using a four-level scale to calculate overall readiness. Students whose “Total Scores” fall into categories
            three and four (“Ready and Practicing” and “Ready and Performing Independently”) are identified as ready.

    <div class="description">    
            Overall, 86.24% of Vermont students were deemed ready for Kindergarten in 2021. 
            8% more girls were ready for Kindergarten than boys, and 12% more kids not elegible for
            free and reduced lunch were ready than kids not elegible for free and reduced lunch. It's
            hard to draw conclusions from public versus not pre-k because because the category includes both.
